      <description>A bit underwhelming.
The authors try and represent a clear picture of the event surrounding the death of Philip II of Macedon, but the accounts and any historical reconstruction is nearly impossible because of the lack of reliable sources.
Therefore, the narrative delves deeper than I would&amp;rsquo;ve liked into dramatization.
I can recommend it as a very light read before going to bed if you&amp;rsquo;re a novice approaching the subject; but otherwise it lacks substance.</description>

      <title>Grandi Delitti nella Storia - I Gracchi</title>

      <description>I quite liked this one;
it is the first book I read in 2021 and the first one I came across from the collection of &amp;ldquo;Grandi Delitti della Storia&amp;rdquo; (that translates into: Great Murders of History), a curated series by Corriere della Sera.
I&amp;rsquo;ve always been fascinated by famous murders as they often are breakpoints in the ebb and flow of History and become catalysts of change.
They are also surprisingly often well documented, either because of the morbidity inherent to human nature or maybe because the are a nice break from the apparent plainness of History.</description>
