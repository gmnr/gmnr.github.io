## to transform into html
I have no CompSci background, but I am *quite* passionate about this whole computer thinghy.

With no formal education and very little experience in the field (even though I ended up working for an IT company anyway) it's hard to make a living with the things that you like.

Therefore, I have carved up a place for this hobby in my spare time and so I read a lot, follow tutorials and try (and fail) the [advent of code ](https://adventofcode.com) challenges.

Right now I have my eyes on the following topics:

* System's Design
* Software Optimization
* Networking


### Programming Languages
---
The first language I ever came in contact with is python, and I have been in love ever since. Now I feel pretty confident with it (I am by no means a master) but I recognize the need to broaden my horizons.
In the near future, I would like to try my hand at C or Java or Haskell.

Some other languages that I have practical knowledge with are:

* Bash (and the Linux environment in general)
* Postgres
* Javascript


### Why this blog?
---
I actually stated this blog as an exercise; I do a lot of wierd stuff in my spare time (programming wise) that ranges from little snippets of code just to prove a point with friends to more organic and coherent projects.

Furthermore, I have always been at a loss of word (for lack of a better term) and I believe that my communications skills are below average...

So this little corner of the internet achieves two things:

1. allows me to share with the world the things that I am passionate about
2. helps me building confidence in writing (I am **always** open for feedback.. as gnarly as it could be)
