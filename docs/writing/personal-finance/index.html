    <figcaption>This is how I Imagine my savings growing</figcaption>
</figure>
</p>
<p>This was a long time coming post of sorts, as money management in the last 5
years has become a relevant <strong>trap</strong> of my spare time.<br> I say trap because I
have designed and redesigned the &ldquo;systems&rdquo; with which I manage my money, I have
watched thousands of pills and tips and tricks on personal finance, and have
been, all round <strong>absorbed</strong> by the topic (as I usually get absorbed, which sits
one inch short of obsessed).</p>
<p>Not that I really studied the topic, I don&rsquo;t have time for that, but I have
implemented and played around with lot of tools to help bring <strong>awareness</strong> at
the forefront of my conscience when the talk is about money.</p>
<hr>
<p>Before talking about how <em>I do what I do</em>, I think is important to provide a
little bit of context and therefore explain how I got there:</p>
<h2 id="my-money-journey">My money Journey</h2>
<h3 id="1-beginnings">1. Beginnings</h3>
<p>Be me, 2018 ca., I hadn&rsquo;t literally <strong>got a clue</strong>.<br> I worked, had a somewhat
decent salary for my first <em>real job</em> but completely lacked vision about my
finances (despite being a recent business graduate).</p>
<p><em>There was no plan for the money, no accounting of the money, no real awareness
of the money; except for a rough tendency to spend less than I earned.</em></p>
<p>My parents helped me and my brother by paying rent, and all other living
expenses, fun money (and especially drinking money) are mine to manage. With the
benefit of hindsight I recognize that my lifestyle at the time could not have
been sustainable and thus was making it harder to confront with my <strong>real</strong>
spending habits.<br> But then, Being naturally <strong>stingy</strong> with money, I had a
healthy savings rate (that was not intentional) and so little by little my
Bank&rsquo;s account balance was steadily going up.</p>
<h3 id="2-awareness">2. Awareness</h3>
<p>Suddenly, more by imitation than by a genuine own compulsion, (and mostly by
browsing <em>reddit</em>) I became aware that with this approach, inflation was slowly
eating at my savings and that my relationship with money was not optimized.<br>
(Optimization of most things is something that sits often at the forefront of my
conscious thought).</p>
<p>The world is full of opportunities to make use of compound interest rate and
benefit from it, so something had to be done about my financial future and a
plain saving strategy was not going to cut it.<br> So, in august 2018, (also
thanks to <em>reddit</em>) I started a very small accumulation plan (PAC) with my Bank.</p>
<p>The very simple and straightforward plan was:</p>
<ul>
<li>automatically every month the Bank purchases for me a stock that I have chosen
beforehand;</li>
<li>said stock grows in time;</li>
<li>it combats the inflation eroding at my savings.</li>
</ul>
<p>In the beginning, I was a little bit unsure, having started all this by reading
strangers&rsquo; opinions on the internet, and seeing my disposable income curtailed
every month, but habits are a potent force and in the end I got used to having
this automatic withdrawal of my finances.</p>
<p>Obviously the choice of the amount and the stock are the two relevant variables
here:</p>
<ul>
<li>how much are you comfortable giving away each month?</li>
<li>what stock do you pick (on which horse do you bet?)</li>
</ul>
<p>The time frame for this kind of investments is very long, in order to maximize
the effect of compound growth, so in my heart I decided I would not touch that
money for at least 20 years.</p>
<p>I learned very early that stock cherry-picking (or active investing) is not a
sound strategy, as nobody can predict the future and even <strong>trying</strong> to get a
sense of the market trends or of a company&rsquo;s stock price takes a massive
investment of time and attention (without guaranteeing results).<br> So there
would be no stock-picking.</p>
<p>In alternative there is a wide array of passive investing strategies. One such
strategy is investing in index funds, which are a financial product that mimics
the trend of a particular market index, such as the S&amp;P500, or NASDAQ.<br> The
underlying rationale is that by clustering similar companies (by size, by
geographic locating or by industry for example) you can broaden the micro and
macro economic factors that affect that particular &ldquo;segment&rdquo; of interest. But
here&rsquo;s the kicker, by moving the scope farther and farther away from the single
company, you can systematically hedge the risk by taking up the market as a
whole.<br> So there&rsquo;s funds that provide a product that does just that: it
matches the World Index and therefore if the markets go up (and they do, most of
the time) so does this &ldquo;stock&rdquo;. That&rsquo;s the philosophy that underwrites most
personal finance movements (such as Boogleheads) that advocate for long term
investment strategies of the &ldquo;buy and forget&rdquo; kind.</p>
<p>I too decided that this was the way to go, and settled on an index that
replicated the S&amp;P500.</p>
<h3 id="3-refinement">3. Refinement</h3>
<p>Then Covid-19 hit, and my tiny substances started sinking with the global
market. Afraid (with what in hindsight has been a stellar investment from my
part) and trying to stabilize the losses that I was accruing, I basically lump
summed all my savings in the stock I was buying monthly. This had a double
effect:</p>
<ul>
<li>it lowered my <strong>BOOK VALUE</strong> (so I wasn&rsquo;t losing on the position anymore);</li>
<li>locked all my savings in a bear market.</li>
</ul>
<p>At the time, I realize I just panicked, which is the one thing you&rsquo;re really not
supposed to do when passive investing, but it turn out to be quite a catch. The
world was not really ending and I basically (and involuntarily) exploited the
Covid Market Crash.<br> <em>Yay me!!</em></p>
<p>Then, after the crisis passed, I discovered that the stock I was investing in
was not really fiscal efficient because it paid a dividend every three months.
(A better stock is one that reinvests its dividends). Too lazy to re-balance,
and because the performance of said stock is stellar, I still get dividends four
time a year, and pay taxes on them.</p>
<p>But I needed a new product, and to hedge the risk that some time in the future
America could not be anymore the leading economy of the world I decide to invest
into a global index without a geographic/capitalization focus. Therefor I
switched to a product with an accumulation strategy (dividend eventually paid by
the underlying companies get reinvested) based on a world index that took into
account the performance of the global market, de facto betting on the world&rsquo;s
economy as a whole.</p>
<h3 id="4-moving-forward">4. Moving forward</h3>
<p>Right now, having changed life and habits, unfortunately I don&rsquo;t have much
disposable income for investing.<br> (This too is an &ldquo;investment constraint&rdquo;
that has to be accounted for while planning your finances.)<br> What I do most
is tracking performance, Net Worth variation and spending for me, my girlfriend
and my immediate family.</p>
<h2 id="what-does-it-all-mean-then">What does it all mean, then?</h2>
<p>Despite studying business and economics at university, until recently I had very
little clues about managing money. There is a stark contrast between what you
think you know and what you actually end up having <strong>real</strong>, <strong>practical</strong>
experience about.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not something they teach you in school and yet is one of the most important
skills to acquire. Many family problems are coincidentally economic problems,
and I believe everyone would benefit from making a little bit of financial
planning.</p>
<p>Alas, financial literacy, especially in Italy, is not something that is really
taught.<br> Everything that relates to money, administration, taxes and finance
is more or less relegated in a dark corner of everyone&rsquo;s mind only to see the
light of day when tax season hits.<br> I now recognize that this approach is
foolish because:</p>
<ol>
<li>There are opportunities to catch, if one is savvy enough to spot them;</li>
<li>Too little education more often than not causes problem down the road if you
don&rsquo;t have a clear idea about what to do with money (i.e. inflation, bad
investments, the works).</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>Ironically enough, I haven&rsquo;t yet drafted a so called <strong>investment statement</strong>.</p></blockquote>
