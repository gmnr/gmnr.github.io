      <description>This is how I Imagine my savings growing This was a long time coming post of sorts, as money management in the last 5 years has become a relevant trap of my spare time.&#xA;Not that I really study the topic, I don&amp;rsquo;t have time for that, but I have implemented and played around with lot of tools to help bring awareness at the forefront of my conscience when the talk is about money.</description>

      <description>What are ergonomic keyboards anyways? The design, usability and concept of an ergonomic keyboard are enhanced features that provide for a more comfortable (or strictly speaking more anatomically correct) typing experience.&#xA;In order to do so an ergonomic keyboard might have one of the following (or all):&#xA;ortolinear keys: the keys are neatly stacked in line, rather than being aligned diagonally key wells: little depressions that account for the different length of your fingers wrist pads: raised palm rests for a more comfortable typing experience Of course all these &amp;ldquo;improvements&amp;rdquo; come with an hefty premium, that companies charge not only for those upgrades but also for the higher production costs required for an &amp;ldquo;artisanal&amp;rdquo; piece, as these keyboards are hardly mass produced and are almost always mechanic.</description>

      <description>Even a journey of a thousand miles starts with a single step First steps Here it is&amp;hellip; This is my second blog post, ever.&#xA;Why not the first? Because this is the second time that I try blogging.&#xA;I&amp;rsquo;m quite excited to start this journey (again), but I&amp;rsquo;m left with some doubts; one above all: will I be able to keep the commitment and write every now and then?</description>
