      <description>The design, usability and concept of an ergonomic keyboard are enhanced features that provide for a more comfortable (or strictly speaking more anatomically correct) typing experience.
In order to do so an ergonomic keyboard might have one of the following (or all):
 ortolinear keys (meaning the keys are neatly stacked in line, rather than being aligned diagonally) key wells (little depressions that account for the different length of your fingers) wrist pads or raised palm rests (for a more comfortable typing experience)  Of course all these &amp;ldquo;improvements&amp;rdquo; come with an hefty premium, that companies charge not only for those upgrades but also for the higher production costs required for an &amp;ldquo;artisanal&amp;rdquo; piece, as these keyboards are hardly mass produced and are almost always mechanic.</description>

      <description>A ship in harbor is safe, but that is not what ships are built for
 On confrontation I am the kind of person that doesn&amp;rsquo;t like confrontation much (both external and internal). But even so, I recognize the importance of &amp;ldquo;opposition&amp;rdquo;.
With that I don&amp;rsquo;t mean opposition in its general term and therefore I&amp;rsquo;m not advising you to go on and challenge everyone and everything in your life; but rather that you try and look inward, and always strive to challenge yourself.</description>

      <description>Here it is&amp;hellip;
This is my first (ahem second) blog post, I mean, ever.
I&amp;rsquo;m quite excited to start this journey (again), but I&amp;rsquo;m left with some doubts:
 is this going to be an enriching experience? will I be able to keep the commitment and write every now and then?  I&amp;rsquo;m feeling a lot like this:  This is me, when I do stuff  Anyways, I finish the post on a more serious note with a quote that I like very much, that I hope will accompany me during this quest for betterment:</description>
