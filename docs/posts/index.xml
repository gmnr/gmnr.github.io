      <description>What are ergonomic keyboards anyways? The design, usability and concept of an ergonomic keyboard are enhanced features that provide for a more comfortable (or strictly speaking more anatomically correct) typing experience.
In order to do so an ergonomic keyboard might have one of the following (or all):
 ortolinear keys: the keys are neatly stacked in line, rather than being aligned diagonally key wells: little depressions that account for the different length of your fingers wrist pads: raised palm rests for a more comfortable typing experience  Of course all these &amp;ldquo;improvements&amp;rdquo; come with an hefty premium, that companies charge not only for those upgrades but also for the higher production costs required for an &amp;ldquo;artisanal&amp;rdquo; piece, as these keyboards are hardly mass produced and are almost always mechanic.</description>

      <description>A ship in harbor is safe, but that is not what ships are built for  On confrontation I am the kind of person that doesn&amp;rsquo;t like confrontation much (both external and internal).
But even so, I recognize the importance of &amp;ldquo;opposition&amp;rdquo;.
With that I don&amp;rsquo;t mean opposition in its general term and therefore I&amp;rsquo;m not advising you to go on and challenge everyone and everything in your life; but rather that you try and look inward, and always strive to challenge yourself.</description>

      <description>Getting started Here it is&amp;hellip; This is my second blog post, ever.
Why not the first? Because this is the second time that I try blogging.
I&amp;rsquo;m quite excited to start this journey (again), but I&amp;rsquo;m left with some doubts; one above all: will I be able to keep the commitment and write every now and then?
I&amp;rsquo;m feeling a lot like this:  This is me, when I do stuff  As a form of wishful thinking, I hope that this quote below will accompany me during this quest for betterment:</description>
