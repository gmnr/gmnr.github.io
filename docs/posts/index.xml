      <description>A ship in harbor is safe, but that is not what ships are built for
 On confrontation I am the kind of person that doesn&amp;rsquo;t like confrontation (both external and internal) much. But even so, I recognize the importance of opposition.
With that I don&amp;rsquo;t mean the word opposition in its general term and I&amp;rsquo;m not advising you to go on and challenge everyone and everything that is happening to you.</description>

      <description>Here it is&amp;hellip;
This is my first (ahem second) blog post, I mean, ever.
I&amp;rsquo;m quite excited to start this journey (again), but I&amp;rsquo;m left with some doubts:
 is this going to be an enriching experience? will I be able to keep the commitment and write every now and then?  I&amp;rsquo;m feeling a lot like this:  This is me, when I do stuff  Anyways, I finish the post on a more serious note with a quote that I like very much, that I hope will accompany me during this quest for betterment:</description>
