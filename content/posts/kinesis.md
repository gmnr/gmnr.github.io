# My (first) experience with ergonomics keyboards
<!--insert an actual photo of the thing here-->
I don't know when I actually decided that I wanted to own an ergonomic keyboard.
To prepare for that, and I would add "as usual", I just watched a bunch of heavily opinionated Youtube videos to finally resolve into buying one.
Money wasn't an issue, as apparently it never is when I'm thinking of buying something that my friends find ranging from mildly fastidious to extremely annoying.

<!--Anyway, now that some time has passed and I have grown accustomed to it but I don't think I have a fully grown opinion yet. -->

##  What I like
* the way it invites your hand
* the palm rests, which are very comfortable
* the programmability (even though I haven't found the perfect layout yet)

##  What I don't like
* it doesn't look premium **at all**
* it gets very dirty, very quickly
* when you are using it for the first times, it's really hard to type normally but it is also really hard to type on it 

## Take aways
