## On confrontation
I am the kind of person that doesn't like confrontation (both external and internal) much. 
But even so, I recognize the importance of opposition.

With that I don't mean the word opposition in its general term and I'm not advising you to go on and challenge everyone and everything that is happening to you.  
But rather that you look inward, and always try to challenge yourself.

I am a lazy person (*veeery lazy*) but still I try **to do, and read, and learn**  new things that don't immediately come easy to me.

I choose the "hard way" on some aspects of my life because I believe that in the end, I will somehow be better off.
There is also a part of self-believe on this.  
Thinking that applying yourself in something that is hard will help you, it eventually will.


## A note from me, to me
Always remember to challenge yourself by way of thinking and learning, to be in a state of "uncomfortableness".
With that growth and improvement will come "easy".

But even knowing so, doing it is **hard** and I wrote this little note as a reminder for myself that powering through can be worth it.
