## On confrontation
I am the kind of person that doesn't like confrontation much (both external and internal). But even so, I recognize the importance of "opposition".

With that I don't mean opposition in its general term and therefore I'm not advising you to go on and challenge everyone and everything in your life; but rather that you try and look inward, and always strive to challenge yourself.

Everyday, even when I'm exhausted after a long day at work, I still try **to do, and read, and learn** new things, to try what doesn't immediately come easy.

I choose the "hard way" on some facets of my life because I believe that in the end, I will somehow be better off; there is also a strong component of self-belief on this. Thinking that applying yourself in something that is hard will help you, it eventually will.

## A note from me, to me
I say this: always bear in mind to challenge yourself by way of thinking and learning, to struggle to be in a state of "uncomfortableness", with that growth and improvement will come "easy".

But even knowing so, doing it is **hard** and I wrote this little note as a reminder for myself, to never lose determination and always power through.
