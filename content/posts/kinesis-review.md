### Ergonomic Keyboards: a primer
An ergonomic keyboard is a keyboard that does not come in the standard format that keyboards usually have. The design, usability and concept of the input device is somewhat altered in order to provide for a more comfortable (or strictly speaking more anatomically correct) typing experience.

In order to do so an ergonomic keyboard might have one of the following (or all):
- ortolinear keys
- key wells
- wrist pads or raised palm rests 

Of course all these "improvements" come with an hefty premium, that companies charge not only for those improvements but also for the higher production costs required for an "artisanal" piece, as these keyboards are almost always mechanic.

To justify the extra buck of the retail price, the companies that make them usually add some extra features that make these keyboard even more niche. These added functionalities range from improved programmability to rear mirrors (I am not even [kidding](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4-fq8ksZls&ab_channel=LinusTechTips) now).

### Why an expensive yet functional piece of equipment
On my end, I decided to buy an ergonomic keyboard because I was sold on the idea of comfort while typing, of injury prevention and of owning something that (allegedly) would have improved my typing speed. 

However, the main selling point for me was that these keyboards require the user to touch type; all the advantages and perks of an ergonomic keyboard can be attained only if the user has had some experience with touch typing. 
Being forever in pursuit of the "right" way of doing things, and trying to enforce some purity on my end I thought that this could be the perfect challenge for me to finally polish my touch typing skills.

I have therefore decided to buy the Kinesis Advantage 2 Keyboard. Specifically I went for the model with red switches that supposedly make the typing a little bit quieter (and that of course costs extra money).
They choice was made because I reasoned that I wouldn't want to bother other people much and because red is my favorite color.

### Typing with it
The first month or so with the tool itself was kind of terrible; there is no manual on how you should put your hands on it and at what angle keeping the fingers on the keys, the thumb cluster is a very new idea to your brain which is used to use the thumb **only** for the space bar. 

To overcome these hurdles I forced myself onto it by substituting the Kinesis to my regular keyboard and therefore using it for the 10+ hours of my "computer heavy" working day.

The results were rather meager; it's very easy to get the posture wrong, you have to retrain your muscle memory (especially copy/pasting) because now you're doing everything with the thumb and the "feel" of the keycaps is somewhat cheap and clunky. Especially on the keys of the thumb cluster which made an infernal noise of low-priced plastic and springs (the sound of the "enter" key is the worst of all, it rebounds as if there was spring loaded).

Then, little by little, I manage to gain some confidence typing on the new keyboard; I would say that in 3 months I had regained some ease while typing, however, I soon discovered that my typing speed was not improving.
It took me 3 additional months and some deliberate practice typing to becoming confident and not "clumsy" again.

One positive side effect though, is that I don't have un-learned typing on a regular keyboard but rather have been improving there as well. I think this is linked to the fact that forcing you to touch type on a keyboard with ortolinear keys, forces your mind to find the right place for each finger on every keyboard.
So overall my typing speed has risen.

In the end I am not as fast as I had hoped to be with an ergonomic keyboard, but the typing experience is certainly more pleasant. Truly there is an added comfort in resting your palms on a dedicated pad, and on reaching all keys with perpendicular motion, rather than awkward crossing on the left and right.

## My (first) experience with ergonomic keyboards
Even before I learned to type properly, I bought a mechanical keyboard.

I wasn't immediately sold on the premise 

After learning the proper methodology I started As it usually is with such things, after a while typing at 80/90 wpm was not enough


I don't know when I actually decided that I wanted to own an ergonomic keyboard.
To prepare for that, and I would add "as usual", I just watched a bunch of heavily opinionated YouTube videos to finally resolve into buying one.
Money wasn't an issue, as apparently it never is when I'm thinking of buying something that my friends find ranging from mildly fastidious to extremely annoying.

<!--Anyway, now that some time has passed and I have grown accustomed to it but I don't think I have a fully grown opinion yet. -->

###  What I like
* the way it invites your hand
* the palm rests, which are very comfortable
* the programmability, that I am not using to its full potential (but it's a nice to have)

###  What I don't like
* it doesn't look premium **at all**
* it gets very dirty, very quickly
* when you are using it for the first times, it's really hard to type normally but it is also really hard to type on it

# OUTLINE
* introduction >> why i ended up owning a keyboard (because i liked typing, i started looking at what are the most comfortable, ended up looking for the kinesis )
* what are the main features of it (key wells, palm rests that make it comfortable, programmability)
* cons/pros
