Here it is... 

This is my ~~first~~ (ahem **second**) blog post, I mean, *ever*.

I'm quite excited to start this journey (again), but I'm left with some doubts:

- is this going to be an enriching experience? 
- will I be able to keep the commitment and write every now and then?

I'm feeling a lot like this:

Anyways, I finish the post on a more serious note with a quote that I like very much, that I hope will accompany me during this quest for betterment:

> " There is nothing extraordinary in being superior to your fellow man. To be truly extraordinary is to be superior to your previous self "
