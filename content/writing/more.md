## On confrontation

I am the kind of person that doesn't like confrontation much (both external and
internal).<br>
But even so, I recognize the importance of "opposition".

I don't mean it literally; I'm not suggesting you go challenging everyone and
everything in your life but rather that you try and focus inward, always
striving to challenge yourself.

Everyday, even when I'm exhausted after a long day at work, I still try **to
do, and read, and learn** new things, to try what doesn't immediately come
easy.

I choose the "hard way" on some facets of my life because I believe that in the
end, I will somehow be better off; there is also a strong component of
self-belief on this.<br>
Thinking that applying yourself in something that is hard will help you, it
eventually will.

## A note from me, to me

I say this: always bear in mind to challenge yourself by way of thinking and
learning, to struggle to be in a state of "uncomfortableness", with that growth
and improvement will come "easy".<br>
But even knowing so, doing it is **hard** and I wrote this little note as
a reminder for myself, to never lose determination and always power through.
