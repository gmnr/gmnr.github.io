![hello](/img/about/presentation.jpg)  
Hi, my name is Guido.  
I play music (with varied degrees of success and instruments) and I like
computers.

## The Computer Conundrum

I have no CompSci background, but I am _rather enthusiastic_ about computers
(emphasis on both terms).

With no formal education and zero practical knowledge in the field I know
I won't be working around my passion.  
I actually tried getting hired by a tech-company but I ended up working for
a big IT name, albeit for a less technical role that I had hoped for.  
Maybe one day I will write about that too, maybe not.

Therefore, to cultivate this pursuit I have carved up a place in my spare time
by reading a lot of resources, following tutorials and trying (and failing) the
for [advent of code](https://adventofcode.com/) challenges.

Right now I am trying to learn more about:

- System's Design
- Object Oriented Programming
- Software Optimization
- Networking

### Programming Languages

The first language I ever came in contact with is
[Python](https://www.python.org), and I have been in love ever since.  
Now I feel pretty confident with it (but I am by no means a master) yet
I recognize the need to broaden my horizons; in the near future, I would like
to try my hand at something less "user-friendly" and either go down a level of
abstraction (with C) or try a new paradigm (with [Haskell](http://learnyouahaskell.com/)).

Other languages I know?

- Bash (and the Linux environment in general)
- SQL
- Javascript (never actually used for anything)

## Why blogging?

I actually started this blog as an exercise, I do a lot of weird stuff in my
spare time (programming and non-programming wise); this weirdness ranges from
little snippets of code (to scientifically prove a point with my friends) to
more structured projects.

### Finding my voice

I have always been at a loss for word (with an _ironic_ lack of a better term)
and I am convinced that my communications skills, written or oral, are below
average.

So this little corner of the internet tries to achieve two things:

- allows me to share with the world the things that I am passionate about
- helps me building confidence in writing (and I am always open for
  [feedback](mailto:guido.minieri@gmail.com), as gnarly as it could be)

I hope this can be an enriching experience for the both of us!
