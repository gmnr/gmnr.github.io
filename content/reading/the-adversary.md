Fantastic book by Carrère, it had me completely absorbed into the very short
read.<br> It goes on effortlessly, and recounts the meta-narration of the
writing on a book on the subject of a unexpected murder of a family by its head.

The reader is so drawn into the narration that one feels darkly things and
thinks darkly thoughts, because often it takes on the point of view of the
culprit.

It is written in a way that made me believe it was a work of fiction, only to
discover later that it was the chronicle of murders that really happened.

If you go in blind, it is a once in a lifetime experience that will have you
completely hooked.

I will not spoil anything else.
