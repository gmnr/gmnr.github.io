Yet another book from the series of famous murders.  
This time I read about the death of the second Emperor of the Romans: *Tiberius
Caesar Augustus*.

This murder wasn't actually an orchestrated political elimination but rather an
unexpected necessity.  

The story goes that at a rest in Misenum, from a trip from the island of Capri
(where the Emperor had his palace) to Rome, *Tiberius* fell ill and apparently
died.  
At the time the two candidates for the imperial succession were two teen boys:
* *Gaius*, his adoptive nephew (who would be remembered in History as
  *Caligula*) and oldest of the two
* *Tiberius Gemellus*, the Emperor's grandson

After learning of the demise of their sovereign, the attending court in the
villa immediately proclaimed *Caligula*, who was there, Emperor. They were just
congratulating him for his succession that news broke out that *Tiberius* had
revived and was in fact alive.  
With terrific quick thinking *Caligula* had the old Emperor smothered (or
himself did it);
*Tiberius Gemellus* would join him in the Underworld after a few months.

> The Emperor is dead, long live the Emperor.

***

Incidentally, quite recently I visited *Tiberius*' Imperial Palace in Capri!
Now is actually called *"Villa Jovis"* and was rediscovered only in recent
times (the 1700s).

Here below there are some pictures of the palace where the Emperor lived, far
away from Rome's politics, for 11 years.  
I hope that this visual medium can help your feel submerged by the tides of
History:
