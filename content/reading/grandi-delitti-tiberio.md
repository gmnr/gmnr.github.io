Yet another book from the series of famous murders.<br>
This time I read about the death of the second Emperor of the Romans: _Tiberius
Caesar Augustus_.

This murder wasn't actually an orchestrated political elimination but rather an
unexpected necessity.

The story goes that at a rest in Misenum, from a trip from the island of Capri
(where the Emperor had his palace) to Rome, _Tiberius_ fell ill and apparently
died.<br>
At the time the two candidates for the imperial succession were two teen boys:

- _Gaius_, his adoptive nephew (who would be remembered in History as
  <br>_Caligula_) and oldest of the two
- _Tiberius Gemellus_, the Emperor's grandson

After learning of the demise of their sovereign, the attending court in the
villa immediately proclaimed _Caligula_, who was there, Emperor. They were just
congratulating him for his succession that news broke out that _Tiberius_ had
revived and was in fact alive.<br>
With terrific quick thinking _Caligula_ had the old Emperor smothered (or
himself did it);
_Tiberius Gemellus_ would join him in the Underworld after a few months.

> The Emperor is dead, long live the Emperor.

Incidentally, quite recently I visited _Tiberius_' Imperial Palace in Capri!
Now is actually called _"Villa Jovis"_ and was rediscovered only in recent
times (the 1700s).

Here below there are some pictures of the palace where the Emperor lived, far
away from Rome's politics, for 11 years.<br>
I hope that this visual medium can help your feel submerged by the tides of
History:
