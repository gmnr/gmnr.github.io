Yet another book from the series of famous murders.<br> This time I read about
the death of the second Emperor of the Romans: _Tiberius Caesar Augustus_.

This murder wasn't actually an orchestrated political elimination but rather an
unexpected necessity.

The story goes that at a rest in Misenum, from a trip from the island of Capri
(where the Emperor had his palace) to Rome, _Tiberius_ fell ill and apparently
died.<br> At the time the two candidates for the imperial succession were two
teen boys:

- _Gaius_, his adoptive nephew (who would be remembered in History as
  _Caligula_) and oldest of the two
- _Tiberius Gemellus_, the Emperor's grandson

After learning of the demise of their sovereign, the attending court in the
villa immediately proclaimed _Caligula_, who was there, Emperor. They were just
congratulating him for his succession that news broke out that _Tiberius_ had
revived and was in fact alive.<br> With terrific quick thinking _Caligula_ had
the old Emperor smothered (or himself did it); _Tiberius Gemellus_ would join
him in the Underworld after a few months.

> The Emperor is dead, long live the Emperor.

Incidentally, quite recently I visited _Tiberius_' Imperial Palace in Capri! Now
is actually called _"Villa Jovis"_ and was rediscovered only in recent times
(the 1700s).

Here below there are some pictures of the palace where the Emperor lived, far
away from Rome's politics, for 11 years.<br> I hope that this visual medium can
help your feel submerged by the tides of History:
