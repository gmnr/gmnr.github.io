I brought this book with me when I moved from Telese to Naples.<br> I picked it
up because I've always been interested in history and customs of my ancestral
people (I come from a small "new" town, that is located at the heart of the
historic region that takes its name from the Saminte People), and therefore was
excited at the idea of learning more about them.

> [Fun Fact:](#) Telese's name comes from the ancient _Telesia_ a capital of the
> federation of independent tribes deep in Samnite territory

However, I have some problems with _"fictionalization"_, as the acute reader of
this blog will remember.<br> And unfortunately this book reads like an easy
novel, sprinkled with historical, but dangerously **unverified** facts about the
events it depicts.

The book is divided in 17 chapters, each focused on a custom or an aspect of
life in ancient Samnium. With this background it unfortunately presents the
usual washed out "opposed love story" between two young lovers (there is also
some steamy sex!).

It tries to tie everything together with some not-so-veiled winks at
contemporary life in Samnium (for example the name of the wines), hinting at a
sort of continuity between the proud communities of old and their "modern"
inhabitants.<br> But in my opinion these links only water down the credibility
of the story because it looks the book was written only for the sake of these
connections.

In the end every twist is predictable and most of the characters don't have any
depth or development at all. However I must recognize that it would have been a
good play, maybe staged in the belly of the amphitheater of the old Telesia,
giving some life to the decrepit and abandoned ruins.

All in all I ready it voraciously, but the after-taste it left in my mouth was
not good enough to warrant an enthusiastic review.
