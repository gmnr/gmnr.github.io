I found this book in box that was going to be put away, asked my mom about it
and she said it was worth a try.

All in all is not a bad read, but my gripe with it is two faced.

First, the style is not appealing to me at all; phrases often digress to offer
the author a chance to use a certain "poetic flair" that often clouds the
understandability of what's being said.
More often than not, arguments are not presented clearly, or worse grossly
simplified, to enable the use of effect phrases and poetic licenses that
accomplish nothing in moving the arguments forward.

Second, the author has clearly sided with that "movement" that tends to
exalt the glories once passed of the Spanish monarchy in Naples, against the
Unionist movement of the Savoys.
Most of the arguments of the final pages of the book are presented through this
optic, that modern historiography has rejected.

The worst part is probably the beginning, the origin of the city and it's first
centuries are heavily fictionalized, with few and sporadic references to
historical events. Alas, this was the bit that I was most looking forward
to. 

General and quirky trivial is abundant throughout the book, and I found it quite
stimulating for reading forward, however it's not enough to overlook the many
shortcomings in narration and bias that the book presents.
