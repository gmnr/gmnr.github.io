Following the usual format, the book presents the circumstances surrounding the
fall, the flight and the assassination of Rome's most famous orator: _Marcus
Tullius Cicerone_.

In opposition to my likings, it particularly stresses the emotions of
_Cicerone_ himself, the indecision, the fear for his family's life, the last
moments near is villa in Formia.<br>
Such things, as they really went, are forever lost in _History_, but in this
case that awful **dramatization** that much I dislike, was not out of place.

It could be because the sources are quite rich, either because the Republic was
living its darkest moments (i.e. the Proscription lists) or because such
details elicited also the minds of the past.

All in all, I liked the way it was presented and _Cicero_ is absolutely one
character you would want to know about; he truly is the last Defender of Rome's
Republic.

To know more about this titan of the Late Republic I cannot but recommend [this
video by the Youtube channel Historia Civilis](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MkZx0q_3rYI) about the deeds that _Cicero_
himself considered his best.
