The book is a good read; especially if you are a student.  
It can help you adapt and mold your studying strategy in order to maximize your
retention and recollection.

The book itself is about having "a mind for numbers" and improve your stats
while learning STEM topics but I think it truly applies to all fields of
learning.

What I have not so much liked is that it is heavily oriented towards the
education system, helping you "passing the tests" rather than helping you truly
connect with what you're trying to learn and master it.

If you are a student though, know yourself out and give it a try.  
You won't regret it.
