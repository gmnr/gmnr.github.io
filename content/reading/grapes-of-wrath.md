No wonder this is considered a must read.

It took me a fairly long time to finish, being awfully busy and all, but in the end it's one of the best books I've
read in a long time.

The character are so very compelling, the story never boring.

The juxtaposition of a narrative chapter with a descriptive one (each winking each other) keeps a rhythm that is inescapable.

From a legibility perspective I especially enjoyed the way the accents of the characters are written.  
From a moral perspective the social criticism is ruthless.

If you want to know what a Nobel winner reads like, give it a try.
