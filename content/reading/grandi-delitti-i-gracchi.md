I quite liked this one;  
it is the first book I read in 2021 and the first one I came across from the
collection of "Grandi Delitti della Storia" (that translates into: *Great
Murders of History*), a curated series by *[Corriere della
Sera](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corriere_della_Sera)*.

I've always been fascinated by famous murders as they often are breakpoints in
the ebb and flow of History and become catalysts of *change*.

They are also surprisingly often well documented, either because of the
morbidity inherent to human nature or maybe because the are a nice break from
the *apparent plainness* of History.  
One thing is reading about an historical trend, an overarching process that is
the sum of many little changes accrued during many years, or even decades;
another matter entirely is the sudden *shift* that happens in the polarizing
moments after a famous murder.

I find the juxtaposition that lies behind such events very interesting.  
Those people are at the same time **the idea that the past has passed down to
us** (look at Caesar for example, whose name has become the very *concept* of
power) and the **inescapably human vessel of the idea**, with its own merits,
flaws, affections, idea, habits, tastes, feelings and worries.

One moment a king is advocating its agenda or its political program, invested
with all the "implicit" meaning and significance of its role *(the idea)*, and
the next there is nothing more left other than a lifeless corpse *(the human
vessel)* and turmoil *(the change)*.  

And yet, this triple twine is nothing but a *construct* because History is
really what we made of it; a never ending reinterpretation of events from both
the "colored glasses" of the sources of the past and those of the readers of
the present.

Without romanticizing much, all those people who's fate and misfortunes we read
today, stripped of the ideal vest they inevitably fall into, in the end were
just, well, people.  
The same parallel can be made for any human really (even those alive today):
the Pope, the president of the United States, the [Chairman of the Library
Association of Japan](http://www.jla.or.jp/portals/0/html/jla-e.html#jla).

And so, every figure of significance in the whole course of History, in the end
is very much an ordinary human being that traversed *Time* facing, at some
point in its life, the very same hustles and problems that you and me and
billions of others have had to face.

***

In the end I think I liked more the idea that the book represents rather than
the book itself.

The author presents a parallel between the lives of the two Gracchi brother's
Tiberius and Caius because both advocated for better rights for the Roman
people (opposed to the aristocracy) and both died a violent death in very
similar circumstances, roughly a decade apart.

Would definitely recommend this book to begin a journey into the tragic events
that lead into famous murders.  
I have especially appreciated the final section of the book that aims at
providing the reader with useful information and sources with which expand
further on the subject.
