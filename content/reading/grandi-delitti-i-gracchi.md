I quite liked this one;<br> it is the first book I read in 2021 and the first
one I came across from the collection of "Grandi Delitti della Storia" (that
translates into: _Great Murders of History_), a curated series by
_[Corriere della Sera](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corriere_della_Sera)_.

I've always been fascinated by famous murders as they often are breakpoints in
the ebb and flow of History and become catalysts of _change_.

They are also surprisingly often well documented, either because of the
morbidity inherent to human nature or maybe because the are a nice break from
the _apparent plainness_ of History.<br> One thing is reading about an
historical trend, an overarching process that is the sum of many little changes
accrued during many years, or even decades; another matter entirely is the
sudden _shift_ that happens in the polarizing moments after a famous murder.

I find the juxtaposition that lies behind such events very interesting.<br>
Those people are at the same time **the idea that the past has passed down to
us** (look at Caesar for example, whose name has become the very _concept_ of
power) and the **inescapably human vessel of the idea**, with its own merits,
flaws, affections, idea, habits, tastes, feelings and worries.

One moment a king is advocating its agenda or its political program, invested
with all the "implicit" meaning and significance of its role _(the idea)_, and
the next there is nothing more left other than a lifeless corpse _(the human
vessel)_ and turmoil _(the change)_.

And yet, this triple twine is nothing but a _construct_ because History is
really what we made of it; a never ending reinterpretation of events from both
the "colored glasses" of the sources of the past and those of the readers of the
present.

Without romanticizing much, all those people who's fate and misfortunes we read
today, stripped of the ideal vest they inevitably fall into, in the end were
just, well, people.<br> The same parallel can be made for any human really (even
those alive today): the Pope, the president of the United States, the
[Chairman of the Library Association of Japan](http://www.jla.or.jp/portals/0/html/jla-e.html#jla).

And so, every figure of significance in the whole course of History, in the end
is very much an ordinary human being that traversed _Time_ facing, at some point
in its life, the very same hustles and problems that you and me and billions of
others have had to face.

In the end I think I liked more the idea that the book represents rather than
the book itself.

The author presents a parallel between the lives of the two Gracchi brother's
Tiberius and Caius because both advocated for better rights for the Roman people
(opposed to the aristocracy) and both died a violent death in very similar
circumstances, roughly a decade apart.

Would definitely recommend this book to begin a journey into the tragic events
that lead into famous murders.<br> I have especially appreciated the final
section of the book that aims at providing the reader with useful information
and sources with which expand further on the subject.
