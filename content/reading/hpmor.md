What a roller coaster!

I have never been a big fan of fan-fictions, and it kinda shows...<br> During
the read I have changed opinion 4 times about the books, its themes and my
general "appreciation" for it.

In the end I believe it was a worthy read - I basically devoured the book.

My fears for the ending were unfounded, it ties everything nicely (from a
logic's narrative stand point at least).

In general there is less emphasis on the learning opportunity that the book
presents. I initially thought of it as a "rational manual" in disguise but even
though the narration is sprinkled all over the place with rational reminders, in
the end is a book for the sake of the story.

Kinda liked it.
