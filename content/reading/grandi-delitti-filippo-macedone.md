A bit underwhelming.  
The authors try and represent a clear picture of the event surrounding the death of Philip II of Macedon, but the accounts and any historical reconstruction is nearly impossible because of the lack of reliable sources.

Therefore, the narrative delves deeper than I would've liked into **dramatization**.

I can recommend it as a very light read before going to bed if you're a novice approaching the subject; but otherwise it lacks substance.
