Mike Duncan is my favorite podcaster.<br> He ran "The History of Rome" podcast
from 2007 to 2012 explaining in detail the whole history of the Roman Western
Empire.<br> It ran for 73h total, and I relished every last minute of it!
(mostly while commuting by car).

He then published this book that focuses on a period that is _less glamorous_
than the Fall of the Republic but that is nonetheless fundamental in
understanding the shift from Republic to Empire.

Most of the attention, when talking about the constitutional changes that
Augustus will bring forth, is in fact commanded by Caesar (with all the might
that the name brings) often overlooking the fact that Caesar himself is **not by
himself** a watershed figure in the history of Rome but rather is building its
agenda and his prestige and his career on _precedents_ set prominent figures a
generation back. (It is also worth noting that most of the prestige of Caesar is
a direct emanation of the legitimizing PR campaigns of his successor _and
successors_.)

> This book is about that generation (or couple of generations) that, by way of
> conflict, and often violence, slowly transformed Roman society and costumes,
> enabling, without intending, so the rise of the Empire.

History itself is more often than not imagined (and taught as) a series of
compartmentalized, easy to digest _**"moments"**_ often hiding in plain sight
the overarching narrative that binds said moments together.

Is much easier to present Roman History (or any History for that matters) as a
"chronicle" rather than an arch ignoring the fact that aforementioned moments
cannot be _unlinked_ from each other and that each brings forth the next and is
bound by it. What in my opinion is the most fascinating aspect of history is the
**context** in which the story unravels; the subtleties that link together cause
and effect and how the current situation is the result of decisions taken and
precedents set in the past.

This is the ultimate goal of this book: trying to show that the Empire didn't
just pop up overnight because of the immense magnetic pull of certain historical
figures (read: Augustus), but rather the culmination of a slow erosion of the
Republican institutions caused by many factors some generation removed in the
past.

Some of those instruments, dating back to the Gracchi brothers themselves are:

- the discovery of new political tools (i.e. the rallying of _proletarii
  masses_) in pursuing a personal agendas,
- the introduction of violence as an instrument of political participation.

The ambitions of young man, willing to cast aside the yoke of the oligarchy
first in the name of equality and then in the name of personal power, fostered
innovation that basically allowed them to overcome of the costume (the famous
_"mos maiorum"_, the unwritten rules of Roman politics) and introduce
"precedents" that later generations will abuse to pursue personal goals (the
bread and butter of Caesar and Pompey).

This changes happened over the course of "generations", but there are historical
figures that can be seen as catalysts in this process; The major struggles
ensued between the _"Optimates"_ (i.e. the conservative oligarchy) and the
_"Populares"_ (i.e. still members of the same conservative oligarchy, as Rome
didn't have means for the masses of direct political participation, but that
were willing to subvert the State).

Some association of the latter against the first are:

- Tiberius Gracchus vs Scipio Aemilianus
- Gaius Gracchus vs Scipio Aemilianus
- Saturninus & Glaucia vs Scaurus
- Marius & Cinna vs Sulla

---

The point is, before the birth of the Empire, there is a whole **generation**
(or generations) worth of civil strife, where ambitious young men would ride the
political issue of the moment (earlier with the Gracchi: land redistribution,
later with Marius and Sulla: the question of Italian suffrage) in order to
acquire political power.

The book deftly helps explaining this changes, is a read that I know I was
missing and that I enjoyed a lot.
