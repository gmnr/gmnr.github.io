I devoured this book.<br>
I was actually surprised that at night, before bed
I found myself thinking about it and wanting it to read more.

However, while it was indeed an enjoyable read, I expected somewhat more.<br>
Approaching the book I expected it to be more of an essay and with a deeper
technological focus.<br>
Instead it's just a story, which happens to be set in a particularly
"technological period" (the late 90s).

It offer some insight still about the general **"esprit du temps"** but it by no
means dives in the nitty gritty details of implementation or architecture
design.

It was a nice, enjoyable read, but not what I was expecting.

Would read again some time in the future.
