I was really excited for this book; so excited that it actually took me more
than 4 months to finally finish it (eheh).  

I got to this book via a suggestion by [Mr. Rip](https://https://retireinprogress.com/)
that cites it as a very influential read in the journey towards **Financial
Independence** (FI from now onward).

### What is financial Independence?

Technically FI is the status of having enough income to pay one's living 
expenses for the rest of one's life without having to be employed or dependent 
on others. (according to [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_independence) anyways).

However, the book is not about FI alone.  
It proposes itself as a corner stone (on which to elaborate further on your own) of
a new set of beliefs that are aimed at redefining your relationship with money.

This belief system is built upon three core concepts:

1. **Financial Intelligence**: look at your relationship with money objectively
2. **Financial Integrity**: align all aspect of your financial life with your
   values
3. **Financial Independence**: -- *the wikipedia definition* --

Each concept is a step in a journey towards FI, which according to the author is
just a by-product of your newly found balance with money and all it represents
(job, cost of living, worry of the future, etc.), thus liberating you to live
the life that you want.  
Some examples of what that may look like are: continuing with your employment as
if nothing changed, resigning from your job and volunteering for a cause you
deeply care about, taking up part-time jobs to study for new knowledge of a new
skill.

In the book a strong emphasis is put on the fact that the radicate belief that:

> **Money = Happiness**

is in fact a by-product of our consumeristic society and that true happiness
stems from **living your life in alignment with your values.**

Even though I was somewhat prepared for the book, having known the FIRE movement
before, I pleasantly found some new ideas (and tools) that now have their own
place in my system of beliefs.

---

The book is comprised of 9 main steps towards your FI, each with their key
takeaways and recommendations:

#### 1. Making peace with the past

In order to build a healthy relationship with money, is important to first get a
good hard look at your vague beliefs about it.

Nowadays money is a major stress agent of the modern world, especially when
framed as *financial security*; therefore to "clear the air" on the subject the
book provides a fun exercise: you need to calculate the total flow of money that
has entered your life since you were born. At first the task seems impossibile,
after all how can you remember all the transactions that have occurred during
your life, but with the right assumptions and a little bit of guesswork it is
rather easy to get a plausible answer.

This calculation allows you to see how capable you are in generating income and
dispel vagueness and money-anxiety about being able to provide for yourself or
for your family.

Next, it has the reader try and estimate their **Net Worth** (NW) that is:

> **NW = Assets (everything you own) - Liabilities (everything that you owe)**

This is aimed at showing you that there are many possessions in your life (for
which you have exchanged money), but not all bring you the same level of
fulfillment and satisfaction.

#### 2. Convert your money into life-energy

This step surprised me a little, but it is a very effective way of re-framing
what money truly means.

As before, the book teases with a little exercise:
- You would need to deduct from your gross weekly income all accessory costs; for example commuting, eating at work, dressing to impress, "decompression" and entertainment money;
- Then add to your typical workweek (40h) the number of hours that you spend preparing for work, which is time that you are not spending following your true life's direction.

The former divided by the latter becomes your *real* hourly wage and from here you
can convert this amount into the cost of a single dollar expressed life-energy
(e.g. every dollar that you spend represents 15 minutes of your life).  
Thus, working is simply exchanging your **life-energy** for **money**. And
your life energy, **your time**, is the most scarce and most important resource
in your life, **and I agree completely**.

By extension, spending money equals spending your life energy and this powerful
analogy, helps you rethink every purchase you make along the lines of:

> **Is this item really worth XXX hours of my life?**

#### 3. Build your P&L (profit and loss)

For this step you need to build an accountability system to track all the money
that comes or goes into your life. The book provides a template but you're
free to implement your own, as long as income and expenses balance out.

And don't forget to add for each expense category the corresponding amount in
life-energy lest you forget the real value that's behind your purchases.

#### 4. Evaluate your spending with your moral compass

This is an introspective one.  
Each month, after compiling your P&L, you would need to take some time and
reflect on your spending.

- Have you received fulfillment and satisfaction in proportion to the amount
  spent in life-energy?
- Are these expenditures in alignment with your value and life purpose?
- How would these expenditures change if you were not working for a living?

After these reflections for each spending category, mark if your perceived value
has gone up or down.

In the long run, this exercise will help you recognize what expense are bringing
your value and what are instead the product of excessive consumerism.

As the book itself states, **this activity, this honest reflection, is the true
core of the whole program** as it will enable to discover the most important
metric of all:

> **How much is "Enough" for you**

#### 5. Plot it

After you've done your monthly evaluation for sometime, it would be useful to
chart your progress and help you identify trends in your income and expenses.
Moreover, if you are truly reflecting on your relationship with the things you
buy you will automatically see the expense line going down, while your
fulfillment would be trending upwards.

This will provide inspiration and stimulus in continuing your path towards FI.

#### 6. Optimize your spending

This is the most practical step: learn and practice intelligent use of your
money by:

* being conscious of your spending
* learning to purchase (by researching value, durability and repairability)
* pick up skills that might help you reduce your spending (e.g. learn how to
  fix things)

#### 7. Maximize income

The other side of the previous step: learn how to trade your life-energy with
integrity and purpose so that you can achieve higher earnings.

#### 8. Crossover point

At a certain point of your journey the downing trend of your expenses will meet
the raising trend of your investment income.  
That point (i.e. the Crossover point) is reached when you are financially
independent (*congratulations*) and your monthly income from your invested
capital will be equal to your actual monthly expenses.

> **You will have "Enough".**

#### 9. Manage your finances

The final step to financial independence is to become knowledgeable about
long-term income-producing investments so that you can manage your finances for
a steady income sufficient to your need in the long term.

I recommend this book.  
Financial education or even the basics of money management are skills too often
overlooked today. Even if you're not interested in FI, you should at least
consider this ideas in order to build a healthier relationship with money, and
this is the right place to start.
