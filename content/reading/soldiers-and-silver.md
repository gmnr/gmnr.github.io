Finally, after complaining book after book that the authors try to hard to
"fictionalize" history, I have found a book rooted in rational analysis on I
topic that I really like. It does help that the book is none other than the
editing and publication of a doctoral dissertation by the author, and therefore
is steeped in citations and data.

The book compares the **military capabilities** and related **treasury issues**
of five Mediterranean military powers from the year 280 BC to the 168 BC.

Said military powers are:

- The Roman Republic;
- The Carthaginian Republic;
- The Kingdom of Egypt;
- The Seleucid Empire;
- The Macedonian Kingdom.

For each, in turn, it outlines the military capacity (i.e. manpower), fiscal
extraction power (i.e. revenues) and expenditure (both for the military and
other expenses of the state).

The data is based on its own model and estimations derived from, on one hand,
known military outcomes (such as: the Punic Wars and the Macedonian Wars). on
the other from the sporadic reference of state revenues, collection and expenses
scattered throughout ancient sources.

## Findings

The book paints a compelling picture that helps explaining why was Rome so
successful in that period despite brushing total capitulation on multiple
occasions and being, in comparison, a far less rich State than its Oriental
counterparts.

According to the author the keys of the Roman success were its capacity to
operate in multiple war theaters at the same time and most importantly by its
ability to **mobilize** its manpower (due to a combination of its network of
_socii_ and the very social glue that held the Republic together).

I have found it a very enjoyable read, even though it endlessly jumps back and
forth in existing literature (both ancient and modern) to compare and contrast
its findings with those other studies made on the same topic.

The cornerstone of the book is not the quantification per se, but rather the
comparison that the author makes, through its lenses, of the 5 powers.<br> It
this case, relative quantities (of soldiers and silver) are more informative
than absolute ones.

It is in the end a book for a scholar, but one that I have enjoyed quiet a lot.
