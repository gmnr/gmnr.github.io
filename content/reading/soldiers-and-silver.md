Finally, after complaining book after book that the authors try to hard to "fictionalize" history,
I have found a book rooted in rational analysis on I topic that I really like.
It does help that the book is none other than the editing and publication of a doctoral dissertation by the author,
and therefore is steeped in citations and data.

The book compares the **military capabilities** and related **treasury issues**
of five Mediterranean military powers from the year 280 BC to the 168 BC.

Said military powers are:

- The Roman Republic;
- The Carthaginian Republic;
- The Kingdom of Egypt;
- The Seleucid Empire;
- The Macedonian Kingdom.

For each, in turn, it outlines the military capacity (i.e. manpower),
fiscal extraction power (i.e. revenues)
and expenditure (both for the military and other expenses of the state).

The data is based on its own model and estimations
derived from, on one hand, known military outcomes (such as: the Punic Wars and the Macedonian Wars).
on the other from the sporadic reference of state revenues, collection and expenses
scattered throughout ancient sources.

## Findings

The book paints a compelling picture that helps explaining why was Rome so successful in that period
despite brushing total capitulation on multiple occasions and being, in comparison, a far less rich
State than its Oriental counterparts.

According to the author the keys of the Roman success were
its capacity to operate in multiple war theaters at the same time and most importantly
by its ability to **mobilize** its manpower (due to a combination of its network of _socii_ and
the very social glue that held the Republic together).

I have found it a very enjoyable read, even though it endlessly jumps back and forth in existing literature
(both ancient and modern) to compare and contrast its findings with
those other studies made on the same topic.

The cornerstone of the book is not the quantification per se,
but rather the comparison that the author makes,
through its lenses, of the 5 powers.<br>
It this case, relative quantities (of soldiers and silver) are more informative than absolute ones.

It is in the end a book for a scholar, but one that I have enjoyed quiet a lot.
