I read this book in one night;  

As already mentioned in these reviews, I don't particularly like "modern"
History (and for me modern is everything that happened less than 1.500 years
ago); but this beautiful essay by Matteo Albanese showed me that more can be
told about events whose sources are contemporary to us (as expected) but in
a way that feels genuine and engaging.

Telling a story that has been written rewritten, conspired about, put on other
media and much, much discussed is not an easy task, especially from an
Historical point of view. And yet the way the facts surround the famous
*"affare Moro"* are told in this essay specifically outline a new way of
telling History that I had not imagined.  
Facts are not presented in a sensationalized way, but rather by verifying in
every paragraph the checks and balances, the subtle equilibrium of presenting
facts in an aseptic way.

The story being told is not about the front-cover titles and slogan but rather
about a clash between two organizations: one "legitimate" and the other
"clandestine" both with their rules and limitations.

I won't spoil anything else, but you should really check it out.
