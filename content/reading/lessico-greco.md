The idea is interesting, but sometimes I've felt that the chapter was only going on to fill more space of the book.  
I've appreciated the little trivia that I didn't know before.

All in all a nice read, but nothing so breathtaking that changed my perspective.
The name-dropping was strong in this one.

Some of the chapters were better than others, sometimes it felt the author was really milking it.
