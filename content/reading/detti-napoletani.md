I procured myself with a dictionary of short laconic Neapolitan sayings, in
order to pick up some idiomatic expressions and be more colorful when
interacting with others.

It is a collection of popular proverbs of Neapolitan origin and the for each,
the author offers:

- The original spelling;
- an italian translation;
- an explanation, that tries to uproot its origin and its application.

> Nothing really beats a folk saying in efficacy, shortness and effect.

I even bought sticky bookmarks to highlight the pages of the phrases (underlined
with a pencil) that I liked the most.

Some of it is quite fun, but unfortunately most are simply not applicable in my
day-by-day (lots of raging on about marriage infidelity, sleeping with other
women, power and poverty, etc.).

Also, I didn't like the author tendency to magnificate the people of Naples,
always bickering with the "unjust" fame given them by posterity.

Furthermore, I found that some of the explanations were "superficial" in the
sense that often the author was satisfied in giving a "face value" explanation
of the proverb without trying to dig deeper for another layer of meaning (that
was certainly there).

It was a fun read, and a cute little book to add to my collection, but nothing
life changing.
