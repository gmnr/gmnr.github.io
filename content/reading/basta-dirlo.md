Not my favorite read of the year.<br>
I chanced upon it because it was gifted to my girlfriend.

The premise of the book is that there is a strong link between the words we use and our emotions and moods, and the main goal of the author
is to help the reader recognize these connections and use them in their everyday life to "live" better.

In the end it happened to be a very long list of opinionated phrases and expressions that we are supposed to use with intention for a "fantastic and always improving life".
Looked a lot like snake oil.

Also I didn't like the boastful attitude of the author.<br>
Lots of words, very few key usable ideas.<br>
Not recommended.
