Not my favorite read of the year.<br> I chanced upon it because it was gifted to
my girlfriend.

The premise of the book is that there is a strong link between the words we use
and our emotions and moods, and the main goal of the author is to help the
reader recognize these connections and use them in their everyday life to "live"
better.

In the end it happened to be a very long list of opinionated phrases and
expressions that we are supposed to use with intention for a "fantastic and
always improving life". Looked a lot like snake oil.

Also I didn't like the boastful attitude of the author.<br> Lots of words, very
few key usable ideas.<br> Not recommended.
