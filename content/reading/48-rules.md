I have seen this book recommended everywhere and so I decided to give it a shot.

Each chapter is a supposed "law" of power, with a very short summary of the
dos and dont's and then examples (both in accordance and opposition with the law in
question) drawn from anecdotes.
The authenticity of these anecdotes is never in question and yet, I haven't found
a single source that attests to their legitimacy.

Sometimes the laws are contradictory other times the example provided
arbitrarily jumps to conclusions.

In the end, I though it very shallow, and more of a marketing stunt than a real
attempt at putting human power dynamics in a framework.

**Couldn't finish it.**
